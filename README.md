# MARKETPLACE SALES AND LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 2016-2018
### Description
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and logistics performance for a marketplace over the period 2016–2018. The goal is to uncover trends, identify operational bottlenecks, and provide actionable insights to improve business efficiency and decision-making.
### Goal of Analysis
The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:
- Which product categories drive the most revenue and sales?
- How efficient is the shipping process across different categories?
- Which customer cities contribute the most to overall sales?
- Where are the opportunities for improving delivery times?
### Dataset
The analysis is based on 9 separate datasets covering different aspects of marketplace operations (customers, geolocation, order items, order payments, order reviews, orders, products, sellers, product category name translation) from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). These datasets were cleaned, preprocessed, and merged into a single final dataset for comprehensive analysis.
### Tools and Technique
- **Excel**
  - Power Query: merging 9 datasets into a single final dataset, cleaning, and preprocessing.
  - Pivot Tables: analyzing sales trends, logistics performance, and customer contributions.
- **Canva:** create visualizations and presentation-ready dashboards to communicate insights.
### Key Insights
- **Total Sales Revenue:** $76B from 10,200 items sold.  
- **Average Shipping Time:** 11 days overall.
    some high-revenue categories (e.g., Cool Stuff: 12 days, Fashion Bags & Accessories: 14 days) need improvement.  
- **Top City by Sales:** São Paulo.  
- **Category Highlights:**  
  - Cool Stuff contributes 26% of revenue.  
  - Telephony has highest item count but lower revenue due to lower average price than Cool Stuff.  
  - Fashion, Bags & Accessories generate $1.9B but shipping is slower than average, indicating room for improvement.
### Presentation Slide
A presentation slide has been created to **showcase the analysis and key insights** in a clear, visual storytelling format. It complements the data analysis by highlighting trends, top categories, and actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
