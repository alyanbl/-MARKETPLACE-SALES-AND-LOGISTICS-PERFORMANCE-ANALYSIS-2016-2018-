# MARKETPLACE SALES AND LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 2016-2018
### Description
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and logistics performance for a marketplace during the period 2016–2018. The objective is to examine product categories with longer delivery times and generate actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and support better business decision-making.
### Goal of Analysis
The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:
- Which product categories drive the most revenue and sales?
- How efficient is the shipping process across different categories?
- Which customer cities contribute the most to overall sales?
- Where are the opportunities for improving delivery times?
### Dataset
The analysis is based on 9 separate datasets covering different aspects of marketplace operations (customers, geolocation, order items, order payments, order reviews, orders, products, sellers, product category name translation) from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). These datasets were cleaned, preprocessed, and merged into a single final dataset for comprehensive analysis.
### Tools and Technique
- **Excel**
  - **Power Query:** Merged 9 datasets into a single dataset, performed cleaning and preprocessing.  
  - **Pivot Tables:** Analyzed sales performance, logistics efficiency, and customer contributions.  
- **Canva**
  - Designed presentation-ready slides with clear visualizations to communicate insights effectively.  
### Key Insights
- **Total Sales Revenue:** $76B from 10,200 items sold.  
- **Average Shipping Time:** 11 days overall. Certain high-revenue categories (e.g., *Cool Stuff*: 12 days, *Fashion Bags & Accessories*: 14 days) show slower delivery times and need improvement.  
- **Top City by Sales:** São Paulo.  
- **Category Highlights:**  
  - *Cool Stuff* contributes 26% of total revenue.  
  - *Telephony* has the highest item count but generates lower revenue due to lower average prices compared to *Cool Stuff*.  
  - *Fashion, Bags & Accessories* generate $1.9B but have slower-than-average shipping times, indicating room for improvement.  
### Presentation Slide
A presentation deck was created to showcase the analysis and key insights through clear, visual storytelling. It complements the data analysis by highlighting top-performing categories, logistics efficiency, and actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
